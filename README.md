# Ransomware Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for the early detection of ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible. The attackers then demand a ransom payment in exchange for the decryption key. Early detection of ransomware is crucial to mitigate its impact and prevent data loss.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset of over 10,000 file samples, comprising both benign and ransomware files. The dataset contains various static and dynamic features extracted from the files, including:

* **File Header Information:** Machine type, number of sections, timestamps, etc.
* **Import and Export Tables:** Functions imported and exported by the file.
* **Resource Information:** Resources embedded within the file.
* **Behavioral Patterns:** API calls, file system access, network activity, etc.

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale numerical features using `StandardScaler` and `MinMaxScaler`, and encode categorical features using `LabelEncoder`. Feature engineering is performed to create new features based on existing ones, potentially improving model performance. Feature selection techniques like correlation analysis and feature importance scores are used to identify the most relevant features for ransomware detection.

## Methodology

This project explores various machine learning algorithms for ransomware detection:

* **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used for binary classification.
* **Decision Tree:** A tree-based model that creates a series of decision rules to classify data.
* **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and robustness.
* **XGBoost:** A gradient boosting algorithm known for its high performance and efficiency.
* **SVM (Support Vector Machine):** A model that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate data points into different classes.
* **Naive Bayes:** A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
* **LightGBM:** A gradient boosting framework that is highly efficient and scalable.
* **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):** A model that classifies data points based on the class of their nearest neighbors.
* **ANN (Artificial Neural Network):** A model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, capable of learning complex patterns.
* **Autoencoders:** Neural networks used for dimensionality reduction and anomaly detection.
* **Ensemble Learning:** Techniques like Voting and Stacking classifiers are employed to combine the predictions of multiple models, improving overall performance and generalization.

Hyperparameter tuning is performed using `RandomizedSearchCV` to optimize the performance of each model. Model evaluation is conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Confusion matrices and visualization techniques like heatmaps and bar charts are employed to analyze and compare model performance.

## Results

The XGBoost and Random Forest models achieve the highest accuracy, reaching up to 99% in identifying ransomware files. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning contribute to significant improvements in model performance. Ensemble learning techniques further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the detection system.

## Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in combating ransomware threats. The developed model provides a promising solution for early detection and mitigation of ransomware attacks. The findings and insights gained from this project can be further applied to develop more advanced and comprehensive ransomware detection systems.
